This fork removes Sensory and makes a few build file changes so the wake word engine from [KITT.AI](https://github.com/Kitt-AI/snowboy) can be used on 64-bit ubuntu machines.

## About the project

This project provides a step-by-step walkthrough to help you build a **hands-free** [Alexa Voice Service](https://developer.amazon.com/avs) (AVS) prototype in 60 minutes, using a wake word engine from [KITT.AI](https://github.com/Kitt-AI/snowboy). Now, in addition to pushing a button to "start listening", you can now also just say the wake word "Alexa", much like the [Amazon Echo](https://amazon.com/echo). You can find step-by-step instructions to set up the hands-free prototype on [Raspberry Pi](../../wiki/Raspberry-Pi), or follow the instructions to set up the push-to-talk only prototype on [Linux](../../wiki/Linux), [Mac](../../wiki/Mac), or [Windows](../../wiki/Windows).

*NEW!* - [Click here](../../wiki/Conexant2Mic-Raspberry-Pi) for instructions to build the AVS Prototype using a Raspberry Pi and the Conexant 2-Mic Development Kit for Amazon AVS

## What is AVS?

[Alexa Voice Service](https://developer.amazon.com/avs) (AVS) is Amazonâ€™s intelligent voice recognition and natural language understanding service that allows you as a developer to voice-enable any connected device that has a microphone and speaker.

## What's new?

**December 8, 2016:**

The AVS java sample app for Raspberry Pi has been updated for two changes:  

1. The sample app now supports GPIO triggers for use with the Conexant 2-Mic Development Kit for Amazon AVS. [Click here](../../wiki/Conexant2Mic-Raspberry-Pi) for step-by-step instructions.  
2. The sample app is now officially certified for media and music services.  

**October 6, 2016:**

How is this different from the [last Amazon Alexa Pi project](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-avs-raspberry-pi/tree/79b7df7aaa4c5304446f59c0bd3ee2589b245115)? That's easy, a wake word engine is included with this project - [Snowboy](https://github.com/Kitt-AI/snowboy) from  [KITT.AI](http://kitt.ai). When you're finished, you'll have a working voice-enabled AVS prototype.
